The project aims to help students manage their time and tasks effectively with multiple tools, including an AI-driven chatbot, Calendar & To-Do List, Pomodoro Timer, Reminders, Home Control, User Connections, and Eye Comfort Dark Mode, all in one place.

Effective time management is crucial for students to balance academic responsibilities, extracurricular activities, and personal life. Doraemon is designed to address this need by providing a comprehensive suite of tools that promote productivity, organization, and well-being. With the AI chatbot, students can receive personalized assistance and manage their tasks efficiently. The Calendar & To-Do List helps organize tasks and deadlines, while the Pomodoro Timer enhances focus and productivity through structured work sessions.

Additionally, Doraemon keeps students motivated and hydrated with customizable reminders. The Home Control feature integrates smart home capabilities for added convenience. User Connections facilitate collaboration and task-sharing among peers. Lastly, the Eye Comfort Dark Mode ensures comfortable usage during nighttime, reducing eye strain.

This project was built using Flutter for its ability to create high-quality, cross-platform apps with a single codebase, and Visual Studio Code for its powerful and flexible development environment. For the demo, the hardware components included an ESP8266 and a simple LED.

This project has been a wonderful learning journey. Doraemon is more than just an app; itâ€™s a reliable companion for students striving to excel in their studies and maintain a balanced lifestyle.
